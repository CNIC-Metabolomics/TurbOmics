# TurbOmis/TurboPutative

**TurbOmics** is a user-friendly, web-based application designed for the integrative analysis of multi-omics data, including metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics. The platform addresses key challenges in multi-omics integration, particularly those related to untargeted metabolomics annotation and the reliance on predefined knowledge bases, which often limit flexibility and biological discovery.

TurbOmics provides access to advanced multi-omics integration algorithms through an intuitive interface, making them accessible to researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds.

TurbOmics is especially suited for researchers seeking to integrate metabolomics data with other omics layers while retaining control over annotation strategies and pathway definitions.

TurbOmics was developed by the **Cardiovascular Metabolomics Unit** at **The National Centre for Cardiovascular Research** (CNIC, https://www.cnic.es).
